# Docker Flow Projects

Docker Flow is a collections of projects that extend the common Docker usage inside a cluster.

It consists of the following projects:

**[Docker Flow Proxy](http://proxy.dockerflow.com/)**: allows automatic reconfiguration of HAProxy.

**[Docker Flow Swarm Listener](http://swarmlistener.dockerflow.com/)**: listens to Docker Swarm events and sends information about new and updated service to predefined endpoints.

**[Docker Flow Monitor](http://monitor.dockerflow.com/)**: allows automatic reconfiguration of Prometheus.

**[Docker Flow Cron](http://cron.dockerflow.com/)**: provides cron-like time-based scheduling while maintaining fault tolerance features available in Docker Swarm.

**[Docker Flow Let's Encrypt (by hamburml)**](https://github.com/hamburml/docker-flow-letsencrypt): periodically creates certificates and sends them to *Docker Flow Proxy*.

**[Docker Flow Let's Encrypt (by nib0r)](https://github.com/n1b0r/docker-flow-proxy-letsencrypt)**: periodically creates certificates and sends them to *Docker Flow Proxy*.
